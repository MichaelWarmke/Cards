# Cards Project Overview

## Project Description
Cards is a mobile application built with Expo and React Native that provides a digital card game experience. The app allows users to play various card games with digital card representations.

## Project Structure
- **app/**: Contains the main application code using file-based routing
  - **Components/**: Reusable UI components like Card.tsx
  - **Screens/**: Screen components for different views in the application
- **assets/**: Static assets used in the application
  - **images/cards/**: Card images for different suits and ranks
- **components/**: Additional shared components
- **constants/**: Application constants and configuration
- **hooks/**: Custom React hooks

## Key Components
- **Card Component**: Renders playing cards with proper suit and rank, supporting both image-based and text-based representations
- **GameScreen**: Main screen for gameplay

## Development Guidelines
1. Follow React Native and Expo best practices
2. Maintain consistent styling across components
3. Keep card-related logic in dedicated components
4. Ensure proper error handling for missing assets
5. Test on both iOS and Android platforms
